# K-means clustering C code:
  
1. INSTALL A GCC COMPILER AND RUN THIS CODE ON A UBUNTU MACHINE(ALREADY TESTED, MAY WORK ON WINDOWS AS WELL)
2. on command prompt type: gcc -o kmeans kmeans.c -lm ( This will compile the c code and create a kmeans file)
3. TO RUN
./kmeans text-feature-file number_of_rows noumber_of_cols number_of_clusters

# EXAMPLE: 
./kmeans T_7_NORMAL.txt 317 7 3

# OUTPUT will be:
A file called centroids1.out, which contains all the cluster indexes for each row.
